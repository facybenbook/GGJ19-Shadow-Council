# Nice Try Plane

Anchors falling from the sky? As a pilot you can imagine this is not a situation you have trained for...
Work together with other a maximum of 3 other pilots (4 in total) in a desperate attempt to keep the plane leveled in a downpour of everyday commodities like washing machines, pianos, anchors and other crazy things while cashing in on that marvelous gold that's hanging in the air! But be careful. Other pilots might share your love of gold...
How long will the plane last before greed overtakes you?
Inspired by the relationship shared amongst siblings around the world. Who get's the TV tonight? Who can have that last sausage?  Well... the one who takes it. But greed can have its price and only time will tell who will succumb to their need of individual achievement.

*This project was created during the Global Game Jam of 2019*
